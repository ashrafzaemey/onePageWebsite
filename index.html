Stellaris - A Shareware Astronomy Suite

Stellaris is an astronomy software suite that runs on Windows. It is intended to be useful to hobby astronomers.

Project Origins

While it started out as a hobby project, over time, Stellaris has grown to be quite comprehensive. Most astronomy programs display the night sky - and some do so impressively well - but they often don't go much further. One of the aims with Stellaris is to go further than just representing the sky and to provide astronomy-related information in a manner that, hopefully, helps you learn and understand.

Discover Astronomy

Stellaris is able to run scripts written in a language called StellarScript. Running a script is like automating Stellaris. For example, a script can automatically display the night sky, choose a celestial body to examine, and give explanatory comments. Stellaris Software regularly publishes scripts that you may download free of charge. So even between releases of Stellaris, you can stay up to date on the latest celestial events. The scripts can be downloaded from the download area.

Download

You can download the latest version of Stellaris here. The latest version is 1.70 and it was released on Dec 24, 2013.
